# Introduction to Hebrew Kings and Biblical Chronology

There are three parts to this book.

First, I will present the biblical chronology for the book of Kings constructed 
by Edwin {cite}`thiele_mysterious_1983`
Leslie {cite}`mcfall_translation_1991` and Rodger C. {cite}`young_when_2003`.  I will show how this chronology was constructed
and give a proof that it is the only possible chronology assuming certain events occurred.  This will all be done assuming as true the {cite}`noauthor_chicago_1978`.

Second, from this chronology I will get an absolute date for the start of Solomon's sole reign and the beginning of the First Temple.  With that date
I will trace the chronology back to Adam.  This chronology will depend on X points where choices have to be made using different
be made depending on different Scriptural variants of the Masoretic Hebrew Text and the Septuagint Greek Text.  I will present all of the possible chronologies
for this period of time.

Third, since this book is executable, I will demonstrate by calculating where chronologies not in the
possible list above fail.  Those who wish to rescue these chronologies will have sources of inconsistency
that they will have to deal with.  In particular I will looks as the chronologies of James Usshur and Isaac Newton
to show how the process works and how the reader can run the tests himself.  I will then consider
chronologies that have been recently proposed that differ from those in the list of possible chronologies.
